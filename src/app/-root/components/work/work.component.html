            <p> After completing a 6months Training Course at CapaCITI and obtaining an Oracle Java SE 7 Programmer I Certificate,
            I was forunate enough to get into Absa's Younglings Internship Programme.
            Here I was introduced to Web Development as a starting point for 
            expanding my programming skill. I was assigned to a project with a team of four and followed
            SCRUM - a flavour of Agile as a software development methodology.
